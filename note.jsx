        This was an amazing bootcamp taken up by Shaurya Sinha. We covered
        everything from scratch including Javascript, React.js and HTML. <br />
        Thank you sir. I sincerely appreciate ShapeAI for your consideration,
        guidance, help and time for this awesome bootcamp. It really helped me
        to learn about new technologies and also it is full of fun.
